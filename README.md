# signe_langauge_detection_Machine_Learning
This is a project about American sign language detection using different Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Perceptron SVM, Logistic Regression ...
For the dataset, I used data provided by Kaggle that contains images of American sign language in folders labelled from 0 to 9 and from 'a' to 'z'.
