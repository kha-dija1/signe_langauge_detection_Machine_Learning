# signe_langauge_detection_Machine_Learning
This is a project about American sign language detection using different Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Perceptron SVM, Logistic Regression ...
For the dataset, I used data provided by Kaggle that contains images of American sign language in folders labeled from 0 to 9 and from 'a' to 'z'.

Read the file 'explanation.pdf' that explains the dataset, the algorithms, and the results.

The main aim of this project is to enable fluid, barrier-free communication
between sign language users and the rest of the world. To achieve this, we are exploiting
machine learning capabilities to train a model capable of understanding and
interpreting sign language gestures. Our system will be able to detect and
translate a person's signs in real time, thus facilitating communication
with the deaf or hard of hearing.
To implement this project, we are using the methods of HOG (Histogram of Oriented
Gradients) and LBP (Local Binary Patterns) methods to extract the characteristics of hand gestures.
Next, we apply various machine learning algorithms such as KNN (k nearest neighbors)
nearest neighbors), logistic regression, SVM (Support Vector Machines), decision trees, random
Forest and perceptron to understand the context and meaning of these gestures.
Our ultimate goal is to create an accurate, adaptable, and accessible tool that will facilitate
communication between sign language users and the rest of the world. We firmly
and strongly believe that the combination of machine learning and sign language detection
language detection can help break down communication barriers and promote inclusion.
